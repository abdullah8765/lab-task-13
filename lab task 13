Question #1:
Array: [35, 10, 55, 20, 5, 40, 60]
Pivot: 35

Iteration 1:
Compare 10 with 35 → Leave it.
Compare 55 with 35 → Swap 55 with 10.
Array: [35, 55, 10, 20, 5, 40, 60].
Iteration 2:
Compare 20 with 35 → Leave it.
Compare 5 with 35 → Leave it.
Compare 40 with 35 → Swap 40 with 10.
Array: [35, 55, 40, 20, 5, 10, 60].
Iteration 3:
Compare 60 with 35 → Swap 60 with 20.
Array: [35, 55, 40, 60, 5, 10, 20].
Final Step:
Place the pivot 35 in its correct position.
Array: [60, 55, 40, 35, 5, 10, 20].

Pivot 35 is now at index 3.


Question #2:
Selection Sort Dry Run (Descending Order):
Array: [25, 10, 40, 35, 15]
Iteration 1:
Assume the first element 25 is the largest.
Compare 25 with 10 → No change.
Compare 25 with 40 → Update the largest to 40.
Compare 40 with 35 → No change.
Compare 40 with 15 → No change.
Swap 40 with 25.
Array after Iteration 1: [40, 10, 25, 35, 15]

Iteration 2:
Assume 10 is the largest in the remaining sub-array [10, 25, 35, 15].
Compare 10 with 25 → Update the largest to 25.
Compare 25 with 35 → Update the largest to 35.
Compare 35 with 15 → No change.
Swap 35 with 10.
Array after Iteration 2: [40, 35, 25, 10, 15]

Iteration 3:
Assume 25 is the largest in the remaining sub-array [25, 10, 15].
Compare 25 with 10 → No change.
Compare 25 with 15 → No change.
No swap needed.
Array after Iteration 3: [40, 35, 25, 10, 15]

Iteration 4:
Assume 10 is the largest in the remaining sub-array [10, 15].
Compare 10 with 15 → Update the largest to 15.
Swap 15 with 10.
Array after Iteration 4: [40, 35, 25, 15, 10]

Final Sorted Array:
[40, 35, 25, 15, 10]
